'''
Create a class named StringManipulation that has the following specification:
Attributes
words: list of strings, all of which will be in lower case

Methods
(1) __init__: accept a list words as argument and assign it to the corresponding attribute
(2) total_words: return the total number of words in words
(3) count: accept an argument named some_word and return the number of times this word occurs in the list words
(4) words_of_length: accept a positive integer length as argument and return a list of all the words in the list words that have a length equal to length
(5) words_start_with: accept a character char as argument and return the list of all the words in words that start with char
(6) longest_word: return the longest word in the list words; if there are multiple words that satisfy this condition, return the first such occurrence
(7) palindromes: return a list of all the words that are palindromes in words

(1) For those methods where you are expected to return a list of words, make sure that the words in the returned list appear in the order in which they are present in the attribute words.
(2) Each test case corresponds to one or more method calls. We will use S to denote the name of the object.
(3) You do not have to accept input from the user or print output to the console. You just have to define the class based on the specifications given in the question.
